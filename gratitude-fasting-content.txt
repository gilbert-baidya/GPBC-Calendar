I need to create 26 days of Gratitude Fasting devotional content.
Each day needs:
- Topic (English & Bengali)
- Key Bible Verse (NIV English & BBS William Carey Bengali)
- Detailed Reflection (4-5 Bible verses incorporated, substantial content)
- Prayer (with God's promise from Bible)

Days 1-2 are complete. Need days 3-26.

Themes should cover:
- Gratitude for God's character
- Gratitude for provisions
- Gratitude in trials
- Gratitude for relationships
- Gratitude for spiritual blessings
- Gratitude for creation
- Gratitude for guidance
- Gratitude for protection
