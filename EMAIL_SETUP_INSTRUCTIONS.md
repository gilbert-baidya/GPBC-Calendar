# Email Notification Setup Instructions

## Current Status

✅ **Donation Modal**: Working - Click the "💝 Donate" button to see Zelle and PayPal options  
⚠️ **Email Notifications**: Not configured yet - Events are added successfully but no emails are sent

The calendar works perfectly without email setup. Email notifications are **optional** and won't affect any other features.

---

## Why No Emails Are Sent Yet

You need to configure EmailJS (a free email service) to enable automatic notifications. Without this setup:
- ✅ Events are still added normally
- ✅ All features work perfectly
- ❌ No email notifications sent
